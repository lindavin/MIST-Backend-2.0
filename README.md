# MIST_Backend

The backend of MIST. 
**To Run**
* npm install 
* npm start

**Currently working on**
* comments
* workspaces

**Features for the future**
* Challenges: Number Attempted vs Number Completed
* Remixing
* Flagging: Make sure to include a field for marking an image for deletion

**Queries**
* comments
*	featured images
*	workspaces
*	gallery (need t have a conversation with front-end apparently)
*	flagging
*	albums
*	personal images
*	user profile

So we need queries related to those categories to be updated. This is current stuff that we're aware of that still needs to get done.
